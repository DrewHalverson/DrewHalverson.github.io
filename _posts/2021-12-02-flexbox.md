I've been working on deepening my understanding of Flexbox and I wanted to aggregate all of the resources I've found useful in one location. 


### The Odin Project - Foundations

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is a well put together and extrememly useful curriculum for front end web development. 

The initial curriculum goes over web development fundamentals and has an [entire section on Flexbox](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/introduction-to-flexbox)  with tons of good info.


### CSS-Tricks

Css-Tricks has a [comprehensive guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to Flexbox that is easy to understand. It is a great reference for when you forget how a particular component works.

### What the Flexbox

[Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) has a lot of great content and that includes his [video tutorial series on Flexbox](https://flexbox.io).

His instruction is clear and comprehensive and there is plenty of opportunity to code along with him as he walks through all of the details. 

### Flexbox Zombies

Dave Geddes has created a [fun, game-based tutorial for Flexbox](https://geddski.teachable.com/p/flexbox-zombies) that provides another perspective of all the ins and outs of using Flexbox.
You will have to create an account for this one, but the content is worth the effort. 

### Other Resources

The Mozilla MDN site has a great [Flexbox reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox). 

[And more specific info on aligning items.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container) 

[FreeCodeCamp also has a great tutorial.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-flexbox-tutorial-with-cheatsheet/) 

Finally, [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) is another fun game to practice your Flexbox skills with.
