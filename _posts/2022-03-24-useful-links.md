I am currently working on a front end developer degree at Madison Area Technical College. 
There are numerous utilities and websites that I am utilizing for my course work and
I wanted to document them in a blog post for easy access. I'll add to this as I go along. 

# CSS 
[normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/8.0.1/normalize.css) makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing. I prefer this over the meyerweb.com reset CSS because it only targets styles that need
to be normalized. 

[CSS Reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) is a CSS reset tool that gives very generic styles
to reduce browser inconsistencies. 

[Basic CSS Themes](https://codepen.io/collection/DKwPxL) is a handy collection of ready made CSS themes 
that can be used to make projects look nicer. I use it a lot with my JavaScript labs and projects where 
the focus is on JavaScript coding and not CSS.

[CSS Sprites Tool](https://cssspritestool.com/) generates sprites from images. 

[CSS Cheat Sheet](https://overapi.com/css) is a handy guide for reference from overapi.com.

[W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) is a great tool for making sure there
are no errors in your CSS code. 

[Minify](https://www.minifier.org/) is a JavaScript and CSS Minifier. 

[Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) parses CSS and adds vendor prefixes.

[Fun with Flexbox](https://bivrostlabs.com/howto,/flexbox,/tutorials/2021/12/02/flexbox.html) is another post on this blog that contains resources for learning to use Flexbox.


# HTML
[HTML Cheat Sheet](https://overapi.com/html) is another overapi.com guide focused on HTML. 

[W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) is a validator for HTML, XHTML, SMIL, MATHML, etc. 

[W3C Link Checker](https://validator.w3.org/checklink) checks for broken links in HTML pages. 

# General Coding
[Regex Library](https://uibakery.io/regex-library) is a curated list of regular expressions for various languages.

[Regex Cheat Sheet](https://overapi.com/regex) Thanks again, overapi.com. So many good cheat sheets. 


# Git
[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a comprehensive book about Git available for free online. 

[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) is a great article on writing meaningful commit messages

[Git Cheat Sheet](https://overapi.com/git) is overapi.com's guide to common Git commands.


# JavaScript
[JavaScript Cheat Sheet](https://overapi.com/javascript) most of the things you wanted to know about JavaScript, but didn't feel like searching StackOverflow for. Another great guide from overapi.com.

[Intro to Programming with JavaScript](https://ipjs.rjbielby.com/) was the course website for my first JavaScript class at MATC. Does a good job of covering the basics. 

# Linux / WSL / Server Admin
[A guide for using WSL for Development](https://janelbrandon.medium.com/a-guide-for-using-wsl-for-development-d135670313a6) Is a great article that covers getting set up with WSL on Windows.

# Tutorials / Education
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is a fantastic curriculum for learning web development. There are tracks for Ruby as well as JavaScript. Free of charge.

[Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/)is a great resource for learning PHP and Laravel. Subscription required.

[TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) - Image compression

[UI/UX for Developers](https://d122zmbwgnybx5.cloudfront.net/) is the website for the UI/UX class at MATC. Lots of great material covering a wide range of topics. 

[Why every developer should learn UX](https://uxdesign.cc/why-every-developer-should-learn-ux-5-tips-for-devs-b8870bd5a959) - Great article on UX for developers.
