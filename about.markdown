My name is Drew Halverson.

I am an aspiring web developer, currently enrolled in the Front End Developer program at Madison College in Madison, Wisconsin. 

I'm also interested in playing music on a variety of instruments, luthiery, woodworking, and ADV motorcycling. 

Mindfulness is also very important to me. I have been practicing meditation for over a decade.
